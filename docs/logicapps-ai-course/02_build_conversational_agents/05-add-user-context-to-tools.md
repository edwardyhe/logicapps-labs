# Run connector actions with the signed-in user identity (Module 05)

In this module, you learn how to set up an agent that acts *on behalf of* (OBO) the signed-in user, meaning that the agent can run connector actions by using that user's identity. This module describes scenarios for where to add OBO authorization, known also as *user context*, how to configure the appropriate connections, test with different users, and learn the limitations.

When you finish this module, you'll achieve the goals and complete the tasks in the following list:

- Understand user-delegated versus app-only identities for tools.
- Configure a connector-backed tool to run with user context.
- Test behavior changes across users with different permissions.
- Apply best practices for consent, scopes, and error handling.

## Identities for tools

The following table describes different identities that a tool can use to run actions:

| Identity | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Per-user (OBO) | A connector action runs by using a delegated token for the signed-in user. The result depends on the user's permissions and licenses. |
| App-only (application identity) | A connector action runs by using a managed identity or an app or service principal. The result depends on app permissions and configuration. <br><br>**Important**: Use an app-only identity when the tool performs shared operations that aren't tied to a user like posting to a shared channel, running a back office job, or using a service account. |
| Connection reference | Your workflow binds each connector action to a specific connection that determines how to perform authentication. |

## Scenarios for on-behalf-of (OBO) authorization

When you need a tool to respect the signed-in user's permissions, licenses, or personal data boundaries, set up OBO authorization when available. The following list provides a few common example scenarios:

- Microsoft 365: Read a person's mail, calendar, files, or profile.
- ServiceDesk or ITSM: Attribute actions to the requester.
- Enterprise APIs with per-user authorization or auditing requirements.

Many solutions use mixed authorization methods. For example, a solution might read user data with OBO for personalization, and then perform a write operation by using an app-only identity after explicit confirmation.

## Limitations

In conversational agent workflows, only connectors that work with Microsoft services or systems and use delegated, per-user connections support OBO authorization.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account and subscription. If you don't have a subscription, [sign up for a free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).

- A Standard logic app resource and conversational agent workflow from previous modules.

  - The logic app resource requires that you set up Easy Auth, previously known as App Service Authentication, on your Standard logic app resource.

  - The conversational agent workflow requires a connector operation that works with a Microsoft service or system. The connection must also support delegated, per-user connections, for example, Microsoft 365, SharePoint, or Microsoft Graph. If required, the connection might also need tenant administrator consent.

    > [!TIP]
    > 
    > Make sure to keep tool descriptions concise and include guidance about the data that they access,
    > for example, such a description might say "Gets the signed-in user's next five calendar events."

- The chat client integrated with Azure Logic Apps.

  This chat client handles token delegation for per-user connections. If you want to use a custom client, that client must pass the user token to the agent.

  > [!NOTE]
  >
  > If you are building a custom client that can't pass a user token yet, complete the concepts with the app-only connections.
  > In a later module, you integrate a custom client that supplies the user's access token to the agent.

- At least two test users for conversing through chat with different permissions in your tenant.

  For example, one user might have access to a mailbox or website, while the other user doesn't have access.

## Part 1 - Set up Easy Auth on your logic app

Your Standard logic app resource requires having Easy Auth set up so that the delegated identity can flow. At runtime, the chat client integrated with Azure Logic Apps prompts each first-time user to authenticate and uses their identity afterwards.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open your Standard logic app resource.
1. On the resource sidebar, under **Settings**, select **Authentication**.
1. On the **Authentication** page, select **Add identity provider**. From the **Identity provider** list, select **Microsoft**.
1. Create or select an app registration by using the options for conversational agents.
1. Set up additional checks for the sign-in process, based on your scenario.
1. Require authentication for requests as appropriate for your environment.
1. When you're done, select **Add** to save your selections.

For more information, see the following articles:

- [Authentication and authorization in Azure App Service and Azure Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/overview-authentication-authorization)
- [Configure your App Service or Azure Functions app to use Microsoft Entra sign-in](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/configure-authentication-provider-aad)

## Part 2 - Choose the identity model for each tool action

1. Determine the authorization to use for each tool action.

   - For "my data" or user-personalized operations, such as "Get my upcoming meetings", use OBO.
   - For shared resources or automations, such as "Post today's health status to the operations channel", Use app-only authorization.

1. Document the required scopes or permissions for each tool so you can consent them later.

## Part 3 - Create a per-user, delegated connection

To support delegated user access, create the connection so your tool can use a connector operation:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), open the conversational agent workflow in the designer.

1. In the designer, add or select the connector action that you want your workflow to run with OBO, for example, a Microsoft 365 action.

1. On the connection information pane, select **Create new**, and then select **Create as per-user connection?**, which is required and available for Microsoft service or system connectors.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   >
   > You must create per-user connections with the **Create as per-user connection?** option. 
   > You can't convert an existing app-only connection to a per-user connection, so you must
   > create a new per-user connection. If you don't see the per-user connection option,
   > you might be editing an app-only connection. In thise case, create a new connection.

1. Complete the sign-in and consent flow.

   At this point, any sign-in exists only for validation or consent. At runtime, each chat user authenticates at first use, and their identity is used for subsequent calls.

### Expectations for chat first use and reuse

When a tool first uses a connector action with per-user authorization in the chat client, an authentication prompt appears for the user to sign in. After the user signs in, subsequent calls made with same per-user connection don't require reauthentication.

> [!NOTE]
>
> The connection uses credentials that belong to the user in the chat session, not the connection creator.
> This behavior makes sure that the tool runs with the signed-in user's permissions.

## Part 4 - Test with users who have different access

1. Open the chat client, and start a session as User A.
1. Ask the agent to perform an operation that requires OBO authorization, for example, "Show my upcoming events today".
1. Confirm the tool runs successfully, and the results reflect the data and permissions for User A.
1. Repeat these steps as User B. Verify the tool runs successfully, and the results reflect the data and permissions for User B.

   Based on access, results for User B might differ from User A.

## Part 5 - Plan for client integration (token pass-through)

If your production experience uses a custom chat client that's web-based, mobile, or another service, plan to provide the user's access token to the agent and implement the OBO flow, based on the following process:

1. Capture the user's sign-in through your app. Get an access token for the target resource, for example, Microsoft Graph, with the required scopes.
1. Pass the token to your agent call, based on your integration model (Module 10).
1. Configure your tool to use the delegated token or a connection that recognizes the user's context.

For more information, see Module 10 â€” Connect your agents using A2A protocol for details and sample client code.

## Review best practices

The following table describes best practices to consider for OBO authorization scenarios:

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Least privilege | Avoid broad permissions and request the minimal delegated scopes needed for each tool. |
| Administrator consent | Reduce consent prompts during chat by getting tenant administrator consent where required. |
| Sensitive data | Avoid showing personally identifiable information (PII) or secrets. Redact or summarize as needed. |
| Mixed identity patterns | Set up OBO authorization for read operations and use app-only authorization for write operations after explicit confirmation. |
| Clear feedback | Instruct the agent to briefly summarize permission errors and suggest remediation, for example, "You might not have access to this mailbox". |
| Auditing and logging | Track and analyze the tools that run and the identity (user or app) they use by reviewing the workflow run history and telemetry. |

## Troubleshoot problems

The following table describes some common problems and troubleshooting suggestions:

| Problem | Suggestion |
|---------|------------|
| 401/403 Unauthorized | Confirm that the connection uses delegated permissions and the user has access to the resource. Check conditional access policies. |
| Consent or scope mismatch | Confirm that the requested scopes match the operation. Recreate the connection if scopes changed. |
| Token audience (aud) errors | Confirm that the access token is issued for the correct resource when using a custom client. |
| Rate limits (429 errors) | Apply backoff or ask the user to narrow the request. |
| Mixed identity confusion | Check the connection that a tool uses. Make sure to clearly label app-only and user-delegated connections. |
